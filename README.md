This repository consist of the following files:
 - income_pred.ipynb (Jupyter notebook with source code and exploratory data analysis of the dataset)
 - requirements.txt (required python modules)
 - adult.csv (the dataset we use in our project)
 - saved_model (saved classification model, for easier further usage)
 
The project required to solve one binary classification problem - determine whether a person makes over $50K a year.
Our Jupyter notebook with solution has the following structure:
  1. Load Data and Modules
  2. Initial Data Exploration
  3. Data Visualization
  4. Data Preparation
  5. Data Modelling
  6. Models evalution

To solve this task we have prepared and cleaned the data set, after that we've built several classification models and put all of them into comparison scores table, so we chose to use the one that had the best score.
The classification model that we chose was saved to "saved_model" and can be used in the future.
